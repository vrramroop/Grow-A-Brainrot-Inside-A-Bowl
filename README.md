# GrowAFishBowl
Roblox game called Grow A Fish Bowl. Inspired by Grow A Garden by the goat Jandel.
Light AI was used for ideas and some scripting (very buggy and barely worked too!)
Modeling is the main amount of time for this project.
There are 2 types of files in this project: Devlog files and Version files. Devlog files are well, for devlogs. Version files are for each session and what has been changed in that session.
